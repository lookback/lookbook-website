      One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself
      transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like
      back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly,
      slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was
      hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many
      legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved
      about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It
      wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small,
      lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile
      samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman -
      and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an
      illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady
      fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur
      muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor
      then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.
