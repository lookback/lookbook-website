# Building custom CSS

This is how you can use the Lookbook in non-trivial cases. If you just want to use the CSS as-is, see ["Using the CSS"](/tech/css).

Start with installing the Javascript module in your project:

```
npm install --save-dev lookback/lookbook
```

Now you can use the `lookbook` module in your build chain.

For further details and API docs, see the README of the Lookbook module on GitHub:
