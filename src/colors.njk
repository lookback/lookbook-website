  <h1>Colors</h1>

  <h2>Complete system</h2>

  <p>Our color system includes of <strong>7 hues</strong> (including grey), each consisting of <strong>10 shades</strong>. The scale goes from the numbers 10-100. Each color in the scale is named according to the scheme <code>{color}-{number}</code>, such as <code>orange-50</code>.</p>

  <p>You can read more about our <em>brand colors</em> (building upon this system) in <a href="{{ '/brand' | url}}">"Brand"</a>.</p>

  <div class="color-grid">
    {% for name, code in lookbook.colors %}
      <div class="color-grid__cell" title="{{ name }}" style="background-color: var(--{{ name }})">{{ name }}</div>
    {% else %}
      <p class="text-grey-60">No colors configured.</p>
    {% endfor %}
  </div>

  <h2>Recommended colors</h2>

  <p>It's not likely that you'll use all colors in a given scale however. These are recommended, safe colors, included in the Lookbook CSS:</p>

  <p>Also see <a href="{{ '/tech/variables' | url }}">"Variables"</a> if you'd like to use the colors as CSS Custom Properties.</p>

  <h2>Wide gamut colors</h2>

  <p>
    We make use of wide gamut colors with the Display P3 color space on supported devices and browsers. These colours look more vibrant and saturated. All color variables in the CSS are automatically in the Display P3 space if the browser supports it.
